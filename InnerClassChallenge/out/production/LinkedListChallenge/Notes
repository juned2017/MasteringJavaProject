//modify the playlist challenge so that the album class uses an inner class

//instead of using an ArrayList to hold its tracks, it will use an inner class called SongList
//the inner SongList class will use an ArrayList and will provide a method to ad a song

//it will also provide findSong() methods which will be used by the contaiing album class

// to add songs to the playlist

//neither the Song class or the Main class should be changed.
