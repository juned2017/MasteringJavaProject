Create a simple interface that allows an object to be saved to some sort of storage medioum.

the exact type of medium is not known to the interface (nor to the classes that implement it).

the interface will just specify 2 methods, one to retun an ArrayList of values to be saved

and the other to populate the object's fields from an ArrayList.
//

create some sample classes that implement your saveable interface (we've used the idea of a game,
with Players and Monsters, but you can create any type of classes that you want).
//

Override the toString() method for each of your classes so that they can be easily printed to enable the program to be tested easier.

//
In Main, write a mehod that takes an object that implements the interface as a parameter and "saves" the values.

//we haven't coveret I/O yet, so your method should just print the values to the screen
Also in Main, write a mehthod that restores the values to a saveable objecgt
Again, we are not going to use java file I/O; instead use the readValues() method below to simulate getting values form a file- this allows you to type as many values as your class
requires, and retuns an ArrayList
