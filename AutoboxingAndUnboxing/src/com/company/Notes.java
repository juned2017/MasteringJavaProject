    //autoboxing: wrapping something to an object
    //unboxing: changing it back to it's original form

//    What are Wrapper classes?
//    As the name says, a wrapper class wraps (encloses) around a data type and gives it an object appearance.
// Wherever, the data type is required as an object, this object can be used. Wrapper classes include methods to unwrap the object and give back the data type. It can be compared with a chocolate. The manufacturer wraps the chocolate with some foil or paper to prevent from pollution. The user takes the chocolate, removes and throws the wrapper and eats it.
//    Observe the following conversion.
//    int k = 100; Integer it1 = new Integer(k);
//    The int data type k is converted into an object, it1 using Integer class. The it1 object can be used in Java programming wherever k is required an object.
//    The following code can be used to unwrap (getting back int from Integer object) the object it1.
//    int m = it1.intValue(); System.out.println(m*m); // prints 10000
//    intValue() is a method of Integer class that returns an int data type.

// you can't save primitive types in an array list. you can only save Class type (String, YourOwnClass etc. )
    //way around it it is by autoboxing and unboxing or InClass like i made above
