//    The sample program is very simple. It is a program to calculate and print a statement of a customer's
//    charges at a video store. The program is told which movies a customer rented and for how long. It then calculates the
//    charges, which depend on how long the movie is rented, and identifies the type movie. There are three kinds of movies:
//    regular, children's, and new releases.
//    In addition to calculating charges, the statement also computes
// frequent renter points, which vary depending on whether the film is a new release.

//    The Enumeration interface defines the methods by which you can enumerate (obtain one at a time) the elements in a collection of objects.
//
//        This legacy interface has been superceded by Iterator. Although not deprecated,
//        Enumeration is considered obsolete for new code. However, it is used by several
//        methods defined by the legacy classes such as Vector and Properties, is used by several
//        other API classes, and is currently in widespread use in application code.
//        The methods declared by Enumeration are summarized in the following table
